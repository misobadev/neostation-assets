Welcome to the official **NeoStation** assets repository. Here you can find and contribute new visual styles to customize system art.

## Repository Structure

The structure is designed to be modular and easy to navigate for both humans and the application:
* `themes/`: Contains all individual system art folders.
* `preview/`: Global screenshots for the catalog display.
* `manifest.json`: Main index used by the app to list available system arts.

## How to Create a System Art

### 1. Folder Setup
Create a new folder inside `themes/` with a descriptive name (e.g., `Matrix-Green`).

### 2. The `theme.json` File
Each system art must include a `theme.json` file with metadata:
```json
{
  "id": "my-unique-art",
  "name": "Visual Name",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Short description of the style.",
  "ai": false
}
```

### 3. Asset Requirements

To ensure optimal performance on handheld and Android devices, please follow these technical specifications:

#### **Backgrounds**
* **Format:** Must be **.webp** (optimized) or **.gif** (animated).
* **Resolution:** Exactly **1024 x 1024** px.
* **Location:** `themes/[your-art]/backgrounds/`
* **Naming:** `[shortname].[extension]` (e.g., `gba.webp`, `ps1.gif`).
* **Fallback:** Always include a `default.webp` for unspecified systems.

#### **Logos (Optional if you need custom logos)**
* **Format:** **.webp** (with transparency).
* **Resolution:** Exactly **800 x 380** px.
* **Location:** `themes/[your-art]/logos/`
* **Naming:** Must match the system `shortname` (e.g., `snes.png`).

## Publishing
Once your system art is ready, ensure you:
1. Add a screenshot to the `preview/` folder.
2. Register your system art in the `manifest.json` file at the root.
3. Open a Pull Request.
